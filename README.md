In HW12, I wrote a simple "HelloWorld" App for a Android Device (MEIZU Android Version 6.0). The App just shows how a slide bar works and displays a value ranging from 0 to 100. It also shows the increase and decrease button with 1 increment per hit, as well as a reset button that can reset the slide bar value back to 50.

Core codes are included in directory "Project_Files/app/src/main": "MainActivity.java" controls the value to increase to decrease as the slide bar or the button is hit; "activity_main.xml" includes the layout settings of the slide bar, the buttons, the orientation of each section, and the text displayed in the App.

The results shows as a screenshot of the App and a demo video of how the app works and interacts with screen touching.
